<p>There are a number of different ways to access the message library.</p>

<p>
A <strong><em>quick search</em></strong> allows you to type in a key word and the tool will list all messages related to that particular word or phrase categorised under the following table headings: Issue, Threat, At Risk Group, Target Audience, Information Requirement and Examples. For example, typing in ‘diarrhoea’ will show all messages related to diarrhoea under Health, Nutrition and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.
</p>

<p>
The <strong><em>advanced search</em></strong> allows the user to select their search criteria from a set of drop down menus. The user has a choice of viewing the list of issues in two different ways - through an alphabetical list or via 'sectors' or clusters.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that in the advanced search option, individual ‘threats’ are linked to “issues” so you would need to first identify the “issue” in order to get the corresponding “threats”.
</p>

<p>
The other main drop down menus - ‘Threat’, ‘At-Risk Group’ and ‘Target Audience’ act as filters. The user simply selects an item from the list from each drop down menu and then clicks search. For example, if the user is looking for hygiene messages to prevent cholera in children, they can do the following: </p>
<p>

<ul>
  <li>a)   Under ‘issue’ - choose <strong><em>Communicable diseases</em></strong></li>
  <li>b)   Under ‘threat’ - choose <strong><em>Cholera</em></strong></li>
  <li>c)   Under ‘at-risk group’- choose <strong><em>Children</em></strong></li>
  <li>d)   Under ‘target audience’-&nbsp; choose <strong><em>mothers/fathers/other primary caregivers</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
A list of messages will appear from simple alerts, to awareness, self-care and, where applicable, service.
</p>

<p>
There are four different types of messages and they tend to reflect the different emergency phases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <strong>Alerts</strong> are disseminated very soon after an emergency has struck to alert a population to an emerging threat. This could be a tsunami warning following an earthquake, information about an outbreak of disease or threat of aftershocks or on a contaminated water supply.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Awareness</strong> messages are similar to public education. This could be information on recognising symptoms of a condition such as malnutrition, or how to protect assets to ward off food insecurity or how to identify warning signs of unexploded ordnance.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Self-care</strong> messages are designed to give advice to populations in the absence of any assistance. This could be because of security or logistical reasons or simply time related. Examples include how to make homemade ORS, how to treat children who are suffering from influenza or what to do if you have diarrhoea.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Service</strong> messages are basically prompts related to programme interventions and contain practical information such as where to go for assistance, what supplies are being distributed, opening hours, the procedure involved etc.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have finished your search, click on any of the messages in the list and you will access the content of the message itself. In each message there is additional information on 'at-risk' group, target audience, type of message, source (where applicable) and a short text on issues to consider before dissemination.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Message bundles</strong> (NB These are stil in draft form)
</p>

<p>
If you want to quickly refer to a list of the main threats affecting populations in a particular type of emergency,&nbsp; click on one of the <em>‘Hazard specific message bundles’</em>. These are the most important messages to get out to populations in the first 72 hours of an emergency. The hazards listed are Earthquake, Flood, Cyclone and Tsunami. Each bundle includes messages from different sector areas according to key threats facing populations. They can be quickly downloaded, translated, adapted to suit the local context, pilot tested and then disseminated.
